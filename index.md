# Introduction
As you may have guessed, I am Jim and this is my air quoted Blog.
The posts that you may find have are a collections of thoughts and views I may have.
As a fair warning I write the initial drafts of the these post late at night when I can't sleep.
And now for the excuse, if there are not many post here it just means I have be sleeping well at night, which is a good thing.

Of course I am on social media, well twitter [@Boomatang](https://twitter.com/Boomatang), reach out and say hi.
I am pretty open to any type of conversation. 
For the people into programming I am on github [@Boomatang](https://github.com/Boomatang) also. 
Go have a look and see some of the work I have been doing there.
But wait that's not all, in a past life I was a draughtsman and spent a lot of my spare time taking photos.
Now I see the world from a very different lens.

Enough of about me, below are some post you might enjoy.
